- **Vulnerability Detection**: Fetches latest vulnerabilities from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses RAG and LLM to analyze vulnerabilities and provide personalized remediation steps
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes system information and vulnerability statistics
- **Security Assistant**: AI chatbot for answering security-related questions
- **Detailed Reports**: Generates comprehensive vulnerability reports with mitigation steps
- **Voice Input**: Optional voice interaction for asking security questions
